# Image-Hosting-for-websites
An image hosting service allows you to upload images to a remote server for viewing online. You can then display the images to users via your website or web application, without having to allocate storage space for images on your web server. 


# Image Hosting vs. Photo Sharing

Here are the key differences between photo sharing and image hosting:
Photo sharing is limited to the platform on which the photo was uploaded. It is typically not possible to embed an image from a photo sharing site to another blog or website. Also, many photo sharing sites are limited to photos and do not support illustrations, avatars, banners, or other types of graphic files.

Image hosting allows you to reach a larger audience. An image hosting service allows and encourages embedding of photos directly on other websites, by providing direct links to images, and other methods like code snippets that allow you to embed an image on a third-party site.
