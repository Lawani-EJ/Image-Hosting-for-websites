# Image-Hosting-for-websites
An image hosting service allows you to upload images to a remote server for viewing online. You can then display the images to users via your website or web application, without having to allocate storage space for images on your web server. 

# Image Hosting vs. Photo Sharing

Here are the key differences between photo sharing and image hosting:
Photo sharing is limited to the platform on which the photo was uploaded. It is typically not possible to embed an image from a photo sharing site to another blog or website. Also, many photo sharing sites are limited to photos and do not support illustrations, avatars, banners, or other types of graphic files.

Image hosting allows you to reach a larger audience. An image hosting service allows and encourages embedding of photos directly on other websites, by providing direct links to images, and other methods like code snippets that allow you to embed an image on a third-party site.

# How an Image Service Works
Image hosting sites usually provide some of all of the following options for uploading files:
1. An upload interface that lets you select files on your local device and upload them to the service
2. The ability to upload a ZIP file and have the service automatically uncompress it and add the files to storage
3. An FTP server that lets you upload files in bulk
4. An API that lets you upload files programmatically
5. An uploader widget that allows users to upload their own files via your website
6. Upload via integration with other cloud storage services

At the end of the upload process, the image is hosted on the server. You then recieve one or more of the following elements that allow you to embed the image on your website or third party sites:

1. A direct link to the hosted image, which can be included in HTML via the `<img>` tag.
2. An auto-generated HTML code that displays the image.
3. BBcode that displays the image.
4. Embeded code that uses JavaScript to dynamically display the image.
5. A Clickable thumbnail that links to the full image.

Image hosts often impose limits on the maximum image size allowed, the total amount of storage, the maximum bandwith allowed per period, or some combination of these. Free services typically have a relatively small per-image size limit compared to paid services.
